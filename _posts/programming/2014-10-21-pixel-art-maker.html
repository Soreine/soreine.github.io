    Pixel Art Maker is a program I imagined when I was playing around with the
    dithering feature of image manipulation softwares like Gimp for
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art">Pixel Art</a> purposes. I
    realised that the Bayer's positional dithering generated some crosshatch
    patterns and wondered how I could make an algorithm that would generate
    arbitrary patterns.
  </p>

  <p>The result is a combination of two image manipulation algorithms :</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Generating an optimized limited color palette for an image.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">Dithering</a> an image with
      an arbitrary color palette, using a user-defined pattern.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The palette generation is made using a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering"
      >K-means clustering</a
    >
    algorithm that tries to find the set of colors that average best the colors
    from the input image.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dithering is a positional ordered dithering algorithm, similar to the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering"
      >Bayer ordered dithering algorithm</a
    >. However, instead of using the optimised Bayer matrix as a pattern, any
    grayscale image can be used as pattern source. This is destined to artists
    wanting to try out some unusual patterns in their creation. Draw a pattern
    image, define a palette and start the dithering. If the result is good, then
    it can be used and tweaked for a handmade piece of pixel art. If the result
    is not satisfying, it does not matter, try out something else, because it is
    fast.
