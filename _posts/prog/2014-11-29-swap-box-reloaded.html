  There is a cooperation game experiment named 
  <em>Swap Box Turbo</em> whose concept is simple yet
  funny. Both players control a little square that can
  jump across platforms. The level is scrolling and the
  squares die when they fall or when they touch each
  other. It's nothing more than a two-player scrolling
  platformer except from that very detail : every two
  seconds, both players controls are swapped. The result
  is a game of concentration, rhythm and cooperation
  with lot of fun. Who the hell has touched the other
  and caused the death of both players is the eternal
  question. Here is a link to
  <a href="http://nifflas.ni2.se/">Nifflas website</a>,
  the creator of the game.

  One day, I played this game with a friend and we both
  enjoyed it. But the game is very short and we were not
  completely satisfied. Because, yes, when you have
  spent a whole hour to complete a 90 seconds level
  which doesn't have a proper ending, you feel
  frustrated.
</p>
<p>
  So we decided to make our own version. The opportunity
  was gold to experiment with game development. For a
  simple game like this, playing directly in the browser
  is convenient, so the <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>
  Javascript library has been our way to go. This game
  engine is simple and leverage the power of the WebGL
  renderer <a href="http://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a>.
  We also wanted procedurally generated levels. This
  adress the problem of the game being too short. So
  we made a seed-based system, where the seed is the
  name of the level.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some characteristics of the game :
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The game is playable in browser (Chrome or
    Firefox are recommended), with one keyboard for both
    player.</li>
  <li>The music along with some visual hints help the
    players to feel the swap tempo.</li>
  <li>All levels are potentially infinite. They are
    generated automatically according to a seed, and can
    be re-generated identically from the seed.</li>
  <li>The variety of levels is easily expandable because
    we use a concept of biome (as in Minecraft) to
    generate the levels.</li>
</ul>
