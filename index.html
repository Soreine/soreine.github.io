    I took inspiration from cool stuff on the Web:
  </p>
  <ul data-from="clean">
    <li>
      Alan Trotter's minimalist <a href="https://alantrotter.com/">website.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      My reference on typography, Matthew Butterick's book
      <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a>. His
      claim about &ldquo;Typography in ten minutes&rdquo; is worth the read.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> as a
      basis for this website's look.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://521dimensions.com/open-source/amplitudejs/"
        >AmplitudeJS</a
      >
      to backup my custom HTML audio player.
